# regulatory_element_details_for_crosswalks

## Validator name

mapping.crosswalk.regulatory_element_details

## Feature

This validator checks whether the details in the `crosswalk` subtype regulatory elements are valid.
Required information for a crosswalk is written in the [Autoware documentation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-architecture/map/map-requirements/vector-map-requirements-overview/category_crosswalk/#vm-05-01-crosswalks-across-the-road).
This validator checks eight types of issues.

The output issue marks "lanelet", "linestring" or "regulatory_element" as the **primitive**, and the regulatory element ID is written together as **ID**.
