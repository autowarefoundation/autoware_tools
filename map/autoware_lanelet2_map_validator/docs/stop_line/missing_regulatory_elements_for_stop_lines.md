# missing_regulator_elements_for_stop_lines

## Validator name

mapping.stop_line.missing_regulatory_elements

## Feature

This validator checks whether each `stop_line` type linestring has a relevant regulatory element.
Required information for a stop line is written in the [Autoware documentation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-architecture/map/map-requirements/vector-map-requirements-overview/category_stop_line/#vm-02-02-stop-sign).

The output issue marks "linestring" as the **primitive**, and the linestring ID is written together as **ID**.
