# regulatory_element_details_for_traffic_lights

## Validator name

mapping.traffic_light.regulatory_element_details

## Feature

This validator checks whether the details in the `traffic_light` subtype regulatory elements are valid.
Required information for traffic lights is written in the [Autoware documentation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-architecture/map/map-requirements/vector-map-requirements-overview/category_traffic_light/#vm-04-01-traffic-light-basics).
This validator checks four types of issues.

The output issue marks "linestring" or "regulatory element" as the **primitive**, and the lanelet ID is written together as **ID**.
